## Challenges

Dealing with RegEx
  * This is a thing I have come across here and there but have never sat down and studied... It's something I should consider though as when working with them on this project I struggled and looking them all I see is a messy string. I do understand *some* parts of RegEx but I do have a lot left to learn.

Learning How to Create Custom Validations
  * Up until this project I have only used the form validations provided by HTML. However to make a matching password validation I had to create a custom validation in JavaScript. This was an easy challenge as it was only a challenge due to the unfamiliarity of the task but after completing it I felt confident in my ability to do it again. I enjoyed this as it was nice to create my own validation and then have to test it to ensure it functioned properly. I did have one issue with this that did get fixed. When validating passwords the "Password" input would only get a green box around it when it matches the "Confirm Password" input. So if the latter is empty then "Password" will show as incorrect. This was fixed by only showing the custom validation on the confirm password input rather than the password input.
